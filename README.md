This project shows how to use object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python by modeling an object â€” a smartphone.

Files
# class.py
Contains the base class Device and the derived class Smartphone with real features like storage, battery, and methods for charging, taking photos, and showing specs.

# polymorphism_demo.py
Shows polymorphism using different vehicle types with a shared move() method that behaves differently in each class.

# Concepts Used
1. Classes and Objects

2. Constructors (__init__)

3. Inheritance (Smartphone inherits from Device)

4. Polymorphism using a shared method (move) across classes

5. Encapsulation (Private attributes like __battery and __storage)

7. Method Overriding
